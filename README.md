## Part 1: NY Parking Violations
The NYC Department of Finance collects data on every parking ticket issued in NYC ( 10M
per year!). This data (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2024/pvqr-7yc4) is made publicly available to aid in ticket resolution and to guide policymakers.
You can find the data from the Link of NYC Parking Data.
The above figure shows several records, where each row represents a parking ticket and the columns are the details of the tickets.

## Part 2: NBA Shot Logs
This is the data (https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/nba-shot-logs ) on shots taken during
the 2014-2015 season, who took the shot, where on the floor was the shot taken from, who was
the nearest defender, how far away was the nearest defender, time on the shot clock, and much
more. The column titles are generally self-explanator
